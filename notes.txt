The algorithm behind this code is to generate a random undirected graph with a given number of vertices and edges, and display it graphically.

The algorithm follows these steps:

    Import required libraries (networkx, matplotlib, random)
    Initialize the number of vertices (n) and edges (m)
    Check if the number of edges is appropriate for the given number of vertices
    Create an empty graph using networkx's Graph class
    Add nodes to the graph using the range of n
    Generate edges between the nodes by picking two random vertices and adding an edge between them with a random weight. This step is repeated m times, making sure that the same edge is not added twice and that the edge is not connecting a vertex to itself.
    Use the spring_layout function from networkx to position the nodes in a 2D space.
    Draw the graph using networkx's draw function, with labels on the nodes.
    Get the edge labels (weights) using networkx's get_edge_attributes function
    Draw the edge labels next to the edges using networkx's draw_networkx_edge_labels function.
    Show the graph using matplotlib's show function.

Note: The algorithm uses a brute force approach to generate edges,
which could result in poor performance for large graphs.
A more efficient algorithm would be to use a randomized edge generation method such as the Erdős–Rényi model.
